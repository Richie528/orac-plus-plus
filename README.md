# Orac++

- shift "All Sets" to the left
- show number of solved problems/accessed problems
- show number of people on hof for each problem (click to go to hof)
- colour code the hof counters
- create a set of pinned problems
- clicking on score badge -> submissions, selecting multiple tags

## Bugs:
- pinned problem disappears when no tags selected (i think)
- should make the single scrape async to reduce like loading time
